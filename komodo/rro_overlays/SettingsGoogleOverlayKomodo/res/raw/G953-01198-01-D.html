<h1>Google Consumer Hardware Limited Warranty â€“ Malaysia</h1>



<p>If there are any differences between this Limited Warranty included in the box with your product and the online Limited Warranty available at <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/troubleshooter/3070579"  target="_blank">g.co/devicewarranty</a>, then the online Limited Warranty will supersede the terms of this in-the-box warranty.</p>

<p>This Limited Warranty applies if you are a consumer and purchased your Google-branded product ("Google Product") in Malaysia.</p>

<p>This Limited Warranty is a voluntary manufacturer's warranty. It provides rights separate to rights provided to you by statutory law. Those statutory rights are not restricted or reduced by this Limited Warranty. This means the Limited Warranty benefits are in addition to, and not instead of, your statutory rights. If your Google Product is defective you may have statutory rights which you can claim against the company who sold you the Google Product, in particular for the repair or replacement of your defective Google Product, or alternatively, in some cases and some countries, a refund, a price reduction or the right to cancel the contract for sale and make a claim for damages or expenses.</p>

<p><strong>What does this warranty cover and how long does it last? </strong>Google warrants that the Google Product (including any ancillary parts that may be packaged with it) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use as described in the published product documentation for one year from the date of original purchase by you anywhere in Malaysia ("Limited Warranty").</p>

<p><strong>What is not covered by this warranty? </strong>This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in Malaysia and will only apply if you are a consumer and have purchased your Google Product from Google or its authorized resellers in Malaysia. This Limited Warranty can be redeemed anywhere in Malaysia. This Limited Warranty also does not apply to any consumable parts, such as batteries or protective coatings, that due to their nature diminish over time, unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, nor to any cosmetic damage unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. This Limited Warranty only applies to hardware components (and not to any software elements) of the Google Product and does not apply to damage caused by: (1) normal wear and tear; (2) accidents; (3) misuse (including failure to follow published product documentation); (4) neglect; (5) disassembly (including opening or attempting to open the outer casing of your Google Product); (6) alterations; and (7) external causes such as, but not limited to: water damage, exposure to sharp objects, exposure to excessive force, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the Google product, and extreme thermal or environmental conditions. This Limited Warranty does not guarantee that use of the Google Product will be uninterrupted or error-free. The ninety-day Limited Warranty Google provides for Refurbished Google Products is not applicable to Google Products refurbished by third parties not authorized to do so by Google, even if sold by a Google authorized reseller.</p>

<p><strong>What will Google do? (THIS IS YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THE LIMITED WARRANTY.) </strong>If a defect covered by this Limited Warranty arises and you return your Google Product as directed by Google during the one-year Limited Warranty period, Google will elect, in its discretion, to either (i) repair your Google Product with new or refurbished parts, in order to provide you with a Google Product functionally at least equivalent to a new Google product; (ii) replace your Google Product with a new or refurbished Google Product functionally at least equivalent to a new Google product; or (iii) accept the return of your Google Product in exchange for a refund of the purchase price you paid for your Google Product. For the full one-year period of your Limited Warranty you do not need to show that the Google product was defective on delivery (provided the defect is covered by this Limited Warranty). If Google replaces or repairs your Google Product, the replaced or repaired Google Product will continue to be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period or 90 days from the date of delivery of the replaced or repaired Google Product, whichever period is longer. Before sending your Google Product for repair or replacement you should make a separate backup of any user-generated data that may be stored on your Google Product (if your Google Product allows you to). Repair or replacement of your Google Product may result in loss of your user-generated data. All returned parts for which you have received a replacement will become the property of Google. Nothing in this Limited Warranty will reduce or otherwise affect your statutory rights in relation to your Google Product.</p>

<p>THE LIMITED WARRANTY WRITTEN ABOVE IS THE ONLY EXPRESS WARRANTY GOOGLE PROVIDES FOR YOUR GOOGLE PRODUCT, AND THE ABOVE REMEDY IS YOUR SOLE REMEDY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GOOGLE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, ARISING FROM COURSE OF CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING YOUR GOOGLE PRODUCT, EXCEPT THAT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE PERIOD OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY ABOVE (EITHER ONE YEAR OR NINETY DAYS, DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOUR GOOGLE PRODUCT IS NEW OR REFURBISHED).</p>

<p>Some states, provinces or territories do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>

<p><strong>What if my Google Product also has damage which is not covered by this Limited Warranty? </strong>If, in addition to a defect covered by this Limited Warranty, your Google Product also has damage which is not covered (for example, damage caused by normal wear and tear or misuse by you) then Google is only responsible for addressing the defect covered by this Limited Warranty. In certain circumstances, Google may be prevented or restricted in carrying out the repair work until the damage which is not covered has also been fixed. For example, if your Google Product has a cracked screen then this may prevent Google from carrying out the repair work unless the screen is also fixed. If this happens, where permitted by law, Google may notify you and may give you the option of: (1) Google repairing the damage not covered by this Limited Warranty at your cost (and Google will tell you the amount in advance); or (2) Google returning your Google Product to you without carrying out any repair work.</p>

<p><strong>What if my Google Product is damaged by liquid? </strong>If your Google Product has sustained liquid damage, this Limited Warranty no longer applies and Google will not carry out any repair work.</p>

<p>Google will give you the option of: (1) replacing your Google Product at your cost (and Google will tell you the amount in advance); or (2) Google returning your Google Product to you.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make a claim? </strong>To make a claim under this Limited Warranty, please contact the Google support team for your Google Product at <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/11061156"  target="_blank">g.co/warrantyclaim</a>. We"ll need your name, contact information, and the serial number on your Google Product. Before receiving warranty service, Google may require that you provide proof of purchase details, respond to questions designed to assist with diagnosing potential issues and follow Google"s procedures for obtaining warranty service. Please refer to the following Privacy Policy for more information on how we handle that data: <a href="https://safety.google/security-privacy/"  target="_blank">g.co/privacy</a>. If you use this Limited Warranty in accordance with its terms, Google will be responsible for the packaging and shipping costs associated with returning the Google Product to Google from anywhere in Malaysia. If a replacement or repair is provided, Google will also be responsible for the packaging and shipping costs associated with sending you a replacement or repaired Google Product to anywhere in Malaysia.</p>

<p><strong>Other limitations: </strong>No employee or representative of Google or its affiliates or any third party is authorized to make any modification, extension or addition to this Limited Warranty. If any term of this Limited Warranty is held to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms of this Limited Warranty will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h1>Google Consumer Hardware Limited Warranty – UK, EEA (except France) and Switzerland</h1>
<p>This Limited Warranty applies if you are a consumer and purchased your Google-branded product (“Google Product”) in the UK, EEA (except France) or Switzerland.</p>

<p>This Limited Warranty is a voluntary manufacturer’s warranty. It provides rights separate to rights provided to you by statutory law. Those statutory rights are not restricted or reduced by this Limited Warranty. This means the Limited Warranty benefits are in addition to, and not instead of, your statutory rights. If your Google Product is defective you may have statutory rights which you can claim against the company who sold you the Google Product, in particular for the repair or replacement of your defective Google Product, or alternatively, in some cases and some countries, a refund, a price reduction or the right to cancel the contract for sale and make a claim for damages or expenses.</p>

<p><strong>What does this warranty cover and how long does it last?</strong> Google warrants that the Google Product will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use as described in the published product documentation for two years from the date of original purchase by you anywhere in the UK, EEA (except France) or Switzerland (“Limited Warranty”).</p>

<p><strong>What is not covered by this warranty?</strong> This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in the UK, EEA (except France) and Switzerland and will only apply if you are a consumer and have purchased your Google Product from Google or its authorised resellers in the UK, EEA (except France) or Switzerland. This Limited Warranty can be redeemed anywhere in the UK, EEA (except France) and Switzerland. This Limited Warranty only applies to hardware components (and not to any software elements) of the Google Product. This Limited Warranty also does not apply to any consumable parts, such as batteries or protective coatings, that due to their nature diminish over time, unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, nor to any cosmetic damage unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. This Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by: (1) normal wear and tear; (2) accidents; (3) misuse (including failure to follow published product documentation); (4) neglect; (5) disassembly (including opening or attempting to open the outer casing of your Google Product); (6) alterations; and (7) external causes such as, but not limited to: liquid damage, exposure to sharp objects, exposure to excessive force, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the Google product and extreme thermal or environmental conditions. Liquid damage voids this Limited Warranty. This Limited Warranty does not guarantee that use of the Google Product will be uninterrupted or error-free. This Limited Warranty is not applicable to Google Products refurbished by third parties, even if sold by a Google-authorised reseller. For Google Products refurbished by third parties, you may have statutory rights which you can claim against the party who sold you the Google Product refurbished by a third party.</p>

<p><strong>What will Google do? (THIS IS YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THE LIMITED WARRANTY.)</strong> If a defect covered by this Limited Warranty arises and you return your Google Product to Google during the two-year Limited Warranty period, Google will elect, in its discretion, to either (i) repair your Google Product with new or refurbished parts, in order to provide you with a Google Product functionally at least equivalent to a new Google product; (ii) replace your Google Product with a new or refurbished Google Product functionally at least equivalent to a new Google product; or (iii) accept the return of your Google Product in exchange for a refund of the purchase price you paid for your Google Product. For the full two-year period of your Limited Warranty you do not need to show that the Google product was defective on delivery (provided the defect is covered by this Limited Warranty). If Google replaces or repairs your Google Product, the replaced or repaired Google Product will continue to be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period or 90 days from the date of delivery of the replaced or repaired Google Product, whichever period is longer. Before sending your Google Product for repair or replacement you should make a separate backup of any user-generated data that may be stored on your Google Product (if your Google Product allows you to). Repair or replacement of your Google Product may result in loss of your user-generated data. All returned parts for which you have received a replacement will become the property of Google. Nothing in this Limited Warranty will reduce or otherwise affect your statutory rights in relation to your Google Product.</p>

<p><strong>What if my Google Product also has damage which is not covered by this Limited Warranty?</strong> If, in addition to a defect covered by this Limited Warranty, your Google Product also has damage which is not covered (for example, damage caused by normal wear and tear or misuse by you), then Google is only responsible for addressing the defect covered by this Limited Warranty. In certain circumstances, Google may be prevented from or restricted in carrying out the repair work until the damage which is not covered has also been fixed. For example, if your Google Product has a cracked screen then this may prevent Google from carrying out the repair work unless the screen is also fixed. If this happens, Google may notify you and may give you the option of: (1) Google repairing the damage not covered by this Limited Warranty at your cost (and Google will tell you the amount in advance); or (2) Google returning your Google Product to you without carrying out any repair work.</p>

<p><strong>What if my Google Product is damaged by liquid?</strong> If your Google Product has sustained liquid damage this Limited Warranty no longer applies and Google will not carry out any repair work. Google will give you the option of: (1) replacing your Google Product at your cost (and Google will tell you the amount in advance); or (2) Google returning your Google Product to you.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make a claim?</strong> To make a claim under this Limited Warranty, please contact the Google support team for your Google Product at <a href="http://g.co/warrantyclaim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">g.co/warrantyclaim</a>. We’ll need your name, contact information and the serial number on your Google Product. Before receiving warranty service, Google may require that you provide proof of purchase details, respond to questions designed to assist with diagnosing potential issues and follow Google’s procedures for obtaining warranty service. Please refer to the following Privacy Policy for more information on how we handle that data: <a href="http://g.co/privacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">g.co/privacy</a>. If you use this Limited Warranty in accordance with its terms, Google will be responsible for the packaging and shipping costs associated with returning the Google Product to Google from anywhere in the UK, EEA (except France) or Switzerland. If a replacement or repair is provided, Google will also be responsible for the packaging and shipping costs associated with sending you a replacement or repaired Google Product to anywhere in the UK, EEA (except France) or Switzerland.</p>

<p><strong>Other limitations:</strong> No employee or representative of Google or its affiliates or any third party is authorised to make any modification, extension or addition to this Limited Warranty. If any term of this Limited Warranty is held to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms of this Limited Warranty will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>This Limited Warranty is given by Google LLC, whose registered address is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, 94043, USA, and it gives you specific legal rights.</p>

<p><strong>If you purchased your Google Product in any of the following countries, then the following terms apply:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Where purchased in France:</strong></p>

<p>Your rights under the below detailed guarantees are not limited by any other commercial warranty that Google may offer (like the Google Consumer Hardware Limited Warranty, which is not applicable to purchases of Google Products in France).</p>

<p>As a consumer, you benefit from a legal guarantee of conformity for your Google Product, as well as a legal guarantee for hidden defects of your Google Product, under the conditions set out below.</p>

<p>In the event of lack of conformity, the consumer has a period of two years from the date of delivery of the goods to enforce the legal conformity guarantee. During this period, the consumer is only required to establish the existence of the lack of conformity and not the date of its appearance.</p>

<p>If the contract for the sale of the goods provides for the supply of digital content or a digital service on a continuous basis for a period of more than two years, the legal guarantee shall apply to that digital content or digital service throughout the period of supply. During this period, the consumer is only required to establish the existence of the lack of conformity of the digital content or service and not the date of its appearance.</p>

<p>Under the legal conformity guarantee, the trader is liable, if applicable, for providing all the updates necessary to maintain the conformity of the goods.</p>

<p>The legal guarantee of conformity gives the consumer the right to repair or replace the goods within thirty days of their request, free of charge and without major inconvenience to them.</p>

<p>If the goods are repaired under the legal conformity guarantee, the consumer benefits from a six-month term extension of the initial guarantee. If the consumer asks for the goods to be repaired, but the trader provides a replacement, the legal conformity guarantee is renewed for a period of two years from the date of replacement of the goods.</p>

<p>The consumer may obtain a price reduction by keeping the goods or terminating the contract by obtaining a full refund against the return of the goods, if:</p>

<p>1) The trader refuses to repair or replace the goods;</p>

<p>2) The repair or replacement of the goods takes place after a period of thirty days;</p>

<p>3) The repair or replacement of the goods causes major inconvenience to the consumer, in particular if the consumer bears the cost of taking back or removing the non-conforming goods, or if the consumer bears the installation costs of the repaired or replaced goods;</p>

<p>4) The non-conformity of the goods persists despite the trader's unsuccessful attempt to bring it into conformity.</p>

<p>The consumer is also entitled to a price reduction or to terminate the sales contract where the lack of conformity is so serious as to justify immediate price reduction or termination of the contract. The consumer is then not required to request repair or replacement of the goods beforehand.</p>

<p>The consumer is not entitled to terminate the sales contract if the lack of conformity is minor.</p>

<p>Any period where the goods are not available for use while they are being repaired or replaced shall suspend the remaining guarantee term until delivery of the repaired goods.</p>

<p>The rights mentioned above result from the application of Articles L. 217-1 to L. 217-32 of the French Consumer Code.</p>

<p>A seller who obstructs in bad faith the implementation of the legal conformity guarantee is liable to a civil fine of up to 300,000 euros, which may be increased to 10% of its average annual turnover (Article L. 241-5 of the French Consumer Code).</p>

<p>Legal guarantee for hidden defects</p>

<p>The consumer also benefits from the legal guarantee for hidden defects in application of Articles 1641 to 1649 of the French Civil Code, for a period of two years from the discovery of the defect. This guarantee gives the consumer the right to a price reduction if the goods are kept or to a full refund against return of the goods.</p>

<p>The Limited Warranty mentioned above is not applicable.</p>

<p>If you purchased your Google Product directly from Google:</p>

<p>To make a claim under any of these statutory warranties, please contact the Google support team for your Google Product at <a href="http://g.co/warrantyclaim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">g.co/warrantyclaim</a>. We’ll need your name, contact information and the serial number on your Google Product.</p>

<p>If you are making a claim under the warranty of conformity, you will need to provide proof of purchase in addition to the above.</p>

<p>If you did not purchase the Google Product directly from Google:</p>

<p>You still have the option to make a claim to Google with respect to the warranty against hidden defects by contacting the Google support team for your Google Product at <a href="http://g.co/warrantyclaim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">g.co/warrantyclaim</a>. We’ll need your name, contact information and the serial number on your Google Product.</p>

<p><strong>Where purchased in Italy:</strong></p>

<p>If you are a consumer, in addition to this Limited Warranty, you will be entitled to the statutory warranty granted to consumers under Sections 128 to 135 of the Italian Consumer Code (Legislative Decree No. 206/2005). This Limited Warranty does not affect the statutory warranty in any way. The statutory warranty has a two-year duration from delivery of your Google Product, and may be exercised within two months from discovery of the relevant defect.</p>

<p><strong>Where purchased in Belgium:</strong></p>

<p>If you are a consumer, in addition to this Limited Warranty, you will be entitled to a two-year statutory warranty pursuant to the provisions on the sale of consumption goods in the Belgian Civil Code. This statutory warranty commences on the date of delivery of your Google Product. This Limited Warranty is additional to, and does not affect, the statutory warranty.</p>

<p><strong>Where purchased in the Netherlands:</strong></p>

<p>If you are a consumer, this Limited Warranty is in addition to and will not affect your rights pursuant to the provisions on the sale of consumption goods in Book 7, Title 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.</p>

<p>In the section “What is not covered by this warranty?”, the phrase “Liquid damage voids this Limited Warranty” will be deleted and replaced with “If your Google Product sustains liquid damage, this Limited Warranty will no longer apply and you will not be able to rely on this Limited Warranty for any damage which would otherwise be covered by this Limited Warranty.”</p>

<p><strong>Where purchased in Ireland:</strong></p>

<p>If you are a consumer, this Limited Warranty operates alongside, and in addition to, your statutory rights under Irish consumer law. Under Irish consumer law, if your Google Product is defective or does not conform with the contract for sale, you may be entitled to have the Google Product repaired or replaced at Google’s expense, or you may be entitled to a refund. These Irish consumer law rights expire six years from the date of delivery of your Google Product.</p>
